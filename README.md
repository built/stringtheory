Overview
---------
A long time ago (early 2000s) I thought a good string library might make a decent product. Ha! Right? The original was in Java and this is the .NET port. No one ever bought it but it served me well on a few projects over the years.

The original Java version was lost to the sands of time and the .NET version almost was too. Let's just say that RAID isn't always as awesome as you think. This version is what I've been able to reconstruct from decompiling binaries. Works better than you'd think, but sadly all of the comments have been lost.

Theory of Operation
--------------------
StringTheory is a mutable text buffer. It's handy for use with templates and has many utility methods to do little text chores. The underlying concept revolves around the Copy/Cut/Paste metaphor. See the Core class and how it relates to the StringTheory class to understand that.

Docs & Examples
----------------
Don't have any, sorry. I did create some nice documentation for the Java version. If I find that, I'll post it. Those docs should also have some examples.
